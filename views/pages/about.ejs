      <p>Hi there, Krystian here! I am currently learning everything it takes to be a software developer at CodeFellows. When I am not bunkered down at my desk, you can find me outside with my four dogs, trying out new Korean restaurants, or playing video games. I have a background in Military Intelligence Operations, and aspire to work in the field of Cybersecurity once I complete my studies at CodeFellows.</p>
